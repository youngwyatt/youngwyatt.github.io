### About Me 📰

As a data-driven researcher and aspiring machine learning engineer, I specialize in developing algorithms that make sense of complex physiological data. At the NERVES Lab at the University of Utah, I work at the intersection of rehabilitation and artificial intelligence—using machine learning to improve how we interpret signals from wearable sensors.

My current projects involve building SVM ensemble models to optimize sensor placement for classifying terrain in stroke rehabilitation, and applying reinforcement learning to guide functional electrical stimulation (FES) electrode targeting. This work helps enable smarter, more adaptive neuroprosthetic systems for real-world mobility.

I’m passionate about creating accessible and robust ML pipelines that translate to clinical impact, and I’m always looking to collaborate on projects that merge biomedical innovation with intelligent systems.

Let's innovate together! #ML #AI # RL #DataScience
